<p>I am a graduate student working with <a href="http://www.cns.gatech.edu/~roman/">Roman Grigoriev</a> in the Center for Non-Linear Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology. My research interests include non-linear dynamics, pattern formation, as well as coherent structures and extreme behavior in turbulence. So many other fields of science have robust conceptual frameworks to pull from. Non-linear field theories, in general, lack a well-understood &ldquo;toolbox&rdquo; and for that reason, their dynamics is an incredibly exciting area of study. It&rsquo;s just waiting for us to make the right change in perspective and understand it. To date, reduced-order models are our best bet, which is why I study pattern formation and exact coherent structure theory. Using these tools, I try to make sense of how the world around me works. </p>
<p>While my work now is entirely theoretical and computational, it did not start that way. My science career began as an experimental physicist at Princeton University, working with <a href="https://phy.princeton.edu/people/frank-calaprice">Frank Calaprice</a> and the SABRE collaboration. During my time there, I learned how to design and build scientific systems (to be radioactively pure, chemically resistant, airtight&hellip;the list goes on and on). I got to probe the cosmos for dark matter through building a crystal-scintillating detector that was designed to emit light every time a dark matter particle collided with it. I even got to travel Italy with the collaboration, and work on the Darkside insertion system, nestled deep underneath the Gran Sasso mountain just outside of L&rsquo;Aquila. My time at Princeton University was the first time I ever got to explore the world around me and build contraptions that could ask it how it works. It made me want to be a scientist.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>While my work as an experimentalist was incredibly fulfilling, I was frustrated that company lead-times and technical spreadsheets were getting in the way of my science so often. I knew that I wanted to work in theory, where it would be just me grappling with the physics itself. That&rsquo;s why, in my junior year of undergrad, I walked right into <a href="http://www.physics.emory.edu/faculty/boettcher/">Stefan Boettcher&rsquo;s</a> office and asked to work with him on his research. With Stefan, I studied the asymptotic (in time) dynamics of Quantum Walks and got my first taste of non-linear dynamics. After a few long nights hunched over my laptop and scribbled pieces of paper, I had my first publication.</p>
<p>As I entered into grad school, I transitioned from dynamics on finite-dimensional systems to dynamics on infinite-dimensional systems (as if the former wasn&rsquo;t hard enough). I now spend my time coding and scribbling tiny proofs on the scrap pieces of paper that line my desk, trying to understand the world around me better. I absolutely love the work I do.</p>
<p>My pronouns are He/Him/His, and while I&rsquo;ve never been misgendered, or discriminated against, many incredible people in this community have been. Social justice is very close to my heart, and if there&rsquo;s any way I can help make science more inclusive, please reach out.</p>
