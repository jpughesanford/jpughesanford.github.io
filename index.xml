      <description>Motivation Exact coherent structures (ECS) provide a simplified perspective on turbulence in which entire neighborhoods of points are pushed along a &amp;ldquo;current&amp;rdquo; created by an exact structure. Trajectories will continue along this characteristic flow of one ECS for a bit and get swept away by the &amp;ldquo;current&amp;rdquo; of another ECS. Formally, this has allowed us to model statistical properties of the flow in terms of an expansion around the periodic orbits of the flow.</description>

      <description>Where does the Reynold&amp;rsquo;s Number come from? If you&amp;rsquo;ve had hot coffee, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably noticed the really fast ripples that run across the surface of the liquid as you blow on it to cool it down. This system, your coffee, is quite similar the system of waves rolling across the ocean surface. So, why are the ripples on your coffee so much smoother than those on the Ocean? and why do they travel faster?</description>

      <description>I am a graduate student working with Roman Grigoriev in the Center for Non-Linear Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology. My research interests include non-linear dynamics, pattern formation, as well as coherent structures and extreme behavior in turbulence. So many other fields of science have robust conceptual frameworks to pull from. Non-linear field theories, in general, lack a well-understood &amp;ldquo;toolbox&amp;rdquo; and for that reason, their dynamics is an incredibly exciting area of study.</description>
