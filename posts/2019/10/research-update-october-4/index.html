<p>This week was spent mostly working and fine tuning fellowship applications. That said, this week also required some careful thought into the phase space structure underlying extreme events. Previously, I had been converging a relative periodic orbit that seemed to lie in both the high dissipation and low dissipation regimes of the kolmogorov flow at $Re=40$. Both adjoint looping and direct newton iterations were used to try and converge this orbit, but both converged relatively slowly when compared to other RPOs converged at this Reynolds number and were stopped. That said, the relative residual attained from Newton was small enough to warrant more time investigating this potential RPO.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This potential RPO was found when searching for heteroclinic between high-dissipation and low-dissipation solutions. The possibility exists that this is not actually an RPO, but instead a heteroclinic/homoclinic connection that makes a close pass back upon itself (as in the diagram above). This would explain the local minimum found, although it would not explain the poor convergence of the solvers about this potential solution.</p>
<p>To explore this possibility further, we ran a calculation to see how close the turbulent trajectory was to other known solutions before and after extreme events (including the extreme event that lead us to this potential RPO in the first place). We found that the turbulent trajectory never made a close pass to any known high dissipation solutions. However, is did make close passes to a known travelling wave solution and a known periodic orbit before and after each highly dissipitive event. If a heteroclinic were to exist instead of an RPO (such as in the diagram above), its likely that the travelling wave RE100 and or the periodic orbit PO01 take the place of the endpoints.</p>
<p>To more rigorously analyze which of these states are likely to support connections, we analyzed their spectra, below are the tabulated results</p>

<p>Analyzing the dimension and codimesion of the unstable manifold gives us a better ideas of which solutions be the initial and final points on a heteroclinic connection.</p>
